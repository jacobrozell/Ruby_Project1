#### Short Answer
There were 8 short answer questions. I decided to make a PowerPoint and export it as a PDF. I used 1-2 slides per question and used the Windows Snipping Tool to create pictures of the code I wrote.

#### Problem
The programming problem was to store and maintain a list of movies entered by a user similar to how google stores searches and shows the most recent search on top. We had the starter files main.rb and search_controller.rb to get started with. 

I started with the search_controller.rb file using nano in the bash terminal. I wrote the showList() method and the updateList() and saved the saveListToFile() for later.

I began working in main.rb and created an endless loop to recieve user input (as shown below).

I now had to finish the search_controller file's saveListToFile().

With everything done I had to create a data.txt file and make sure it was working. 
I created a list of some of my personal favorite movies.

Then I checked data.txt to make sure my list was in there.

Since it was working fine, I moved on to documentation.
